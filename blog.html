            <p>Web design has always fascinated me. I started learning HTML and CSS in my free time and slowly built my first personal website. The journey taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of practicing every day.</p>
            <p>Through this project, I explored layout design, typography, and color schemes. By experimenting with different styles, I discovered my personal design style and improved my coding skills significantly.</p>
            <p>One of the most important lessons I learned was problem-solving. When something didn’t work on my website, I researched, tested solutions, and learned to fix issues efficiently. This project motivated me to continue improving and building more complex websites in the future.</p>
